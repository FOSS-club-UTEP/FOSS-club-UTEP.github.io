Official FOSS Club at UTEP website

This is my initial version.
I am basically relearning HTML/CSS and kind of just contributing as a side hobby.

My idea for the site was similar to what was talked about once way back early on in the semester.
This site will be a centralization point that has:
Social media links
Future events
Past events
Club Projects and Repos

My main interest is having a place to share FOSS club repos.
All the repos should be screen, but ideally we can make repos that are tailored as study guides rather than just simple FOSS.

The "landing" page, my intent was to make it resize to mobile screens, and fit good for half screen desktop windows/tiles.
It has proven harder than I realized...

Club colors are red and white, hence why I used red and white.
Different shades and other affects would probably be cool, but for practical purposes I'll leave this like this and wait to hear/see what the Club Leadership wants to do.
